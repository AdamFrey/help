We use a translation tool called [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com) to help manage our localization efforts across many different languages.

If you are interested in helping translate a bitwarden application into another language (or make a translation correction), please register an account at Crowdin and join our projects here: <https://crowdin.com/projects/kspearrin>

If the language that you are interested in translating is not already listed, create a new account on Crowdin, join the project, and contact the project owner (<https://crowdin.com/mail/compose/kspearrin>).

You can read Crowdin's getting started guide for translators here: <https://support.crowdin.com/crowdin-intro/>

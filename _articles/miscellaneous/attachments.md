{% note %}Using file attachments requires a premium membership or paid organization account.{% endnote %}

Attaching and managing files can be done from any Bitwarden client application. Any file  100MB or smaller can be attached to an item in your vault.

All **premium membership** and **paid organization** accounts include 1GB of encrypted file storage. Additional storage can be purchased in 1GB increments if needed.

## Web Vault

Select the {% icon fa-cog %} options button next to the item in your vault and then select the **Attachments** option. You will then be presented with a list of all attached files for that item as well as options for uploading new attachments.

## Other Applications

After viewing an item in your vault you will see existing attachments listed at the bottom of the page. To upload a new attachment, or to delete existing attachments, edit the item and then select the **Attachments** option.

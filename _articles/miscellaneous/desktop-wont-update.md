When attempting to update the desktop application, you may encounter a problem where the application never updates. This will result in you continuing to receive an update prompt each time the application is started. This is due to an issue in an outdated version of the Bitwarden desktop application where the auto-updater fails. If you are affected by this issue you need to manually update to the latest version of the Bitwarden desktop application.

1. Uninstall the Bitwarden desktop application from the device.
  - On macOS, you can do this from **Finder** &rarr; **Applications**. Then right click on **Bitwarden** and select **Move to Trash**.
  - On Windows, click on the **Start** menu and search for **Bitwarden**. Right click on **Bitwarden** and select **Uninstall**. This will open the **Programs and Features** window where you will need to repeat the process again. Locate and right click **Bitwarden**, then **Uninstall**.
2. Download the latest version of the Bitwarden desktop application from [our website](https://bitwarden.com/#download) and reinstall. Newer versions of Bitwarden are not affected by this update error and should auto-update to future versions as expected.

Yes.

By making 100% of our source code available under an open source GPLv3 license, our goal is to be as transparent as possible about how Bitwarden works and how it handles your sensitive data. However, we also understand the need for reputable, independent third-party experts to officially audit the Bitwarden codebase.

Bitwarden has received a thorough security assessment and cryptographic analysis by a third-party security auditing firm. You can read more about this security audit [here](#){:target="_blank"}.

Bitwarden also interacts with independent security researchers through our public bug bounty program on [HackerOne](https://hackerone.com/bitwarden/){:target="_blank"}.

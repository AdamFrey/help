bitwarden processes and stores all data securely in the [Microsoft Azure cloud][azure] using services that are managed by the
team at Microsoft. bitwarden does not manage any server infrastructure or security directly. All data is backed up multiple
times over, again using services provided by Microsoft Azure.

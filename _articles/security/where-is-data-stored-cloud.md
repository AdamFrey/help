bitwarden processes and stores all data securely in the [Microsoft Azure cloud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Azure){:target="_blank"} using services that are managed by the team at Microsoft. bitwarden does not manage any server infrastructure or security directly. All data is backed up multiple times over, again using services provided by Microsoft Azure.

Don't trust the bitwarden cloud? You don't have to. Open source is beautiful. You can easily host the entire bitwarden stack yourself. You control your data. Learn more [here]({% link _articles/hosting/install-on-premise.md %}).

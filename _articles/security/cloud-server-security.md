bitwarden processes and stores all data securely in the [Microsoft Azure cloud][azure] using services that are managed by the
team at Microsoft. Since bitwarden only uses service offerings provided by Azure, there is no server infrastructure to
manage and maintain. All uptime, scalability, and security updates and guarantees are backed by Microsoft and their cloud
infrastructure.

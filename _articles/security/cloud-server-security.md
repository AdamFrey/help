Bitwarden processes and stores all data securely in the [Microsoft Azure cloud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Azure){:target="_blank"} using services that are managed by the team at Microsoft. Since Bitwarden only uses service offerings provided by Azure, there is no server infrastructure to manage and maintain. All uptime, scalability, and security updates and guarantees are backed by Microsoft and their cloud infrastructure.

Don't trust the Bitwarden cloud? You don't have to. Open source is beautiful. You can easily host the entire Bitwarden stack yourself. You control your data. Learn more [here]({% link _articles/hosting/install-on-premise.md %}).

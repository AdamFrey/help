Unfortunately Google has removed the ability to export passwords from Chrome. However, it is suppose to be returning in Chrome 63. You can read more about it in [this topic](https://productforums.google.com/forum/?utm_medium=email&utm_source=footer#!topic/chrome/99KZmH2DRrA){:target="blank"} on their user forums. We will update this documentation if/when it returns.

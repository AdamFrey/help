A Bitwarden organization is an entity that relates users together that want to share logins. An organization could be a family, team, company, or any other type of group that desires to share logins in Bitwarden.

An individual user account can create and/or belong to many different organizations, allowing you to manage your logins from a single account.

You can create a new Bitwarden organization from the [web vault](https://vault.bitwarden.com) or request that an admin of an existing organization send you an invite.

## Are organizations different than premium?

Yes. Whereas an organization is used for **sharing items across multiple users**, a premium membership gives your **individual user account** additional premium features. Some of these features may also exist with an organization (ex. file storage and TOTP), however, they only apply to items that are actually store/shared within the organization. If you also want to use these features on your personal user account you will additionally need a premium membership for that account.

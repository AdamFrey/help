A bitwarden organization is an entity that relates users together that want to share logins. An organization could be a family, team, company, or any other type of group that desires to share logins in bitwarden.

An individual user account can create and/or belong to many different organizations, allowing you to manage your logins from a single account.

You can create a new bitwarden organization from the [web vault](https://vault.bitwarden.com) or request that an admin of an existing organization send you an invite.

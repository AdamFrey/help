Simply place the YubiKey NEO on the back of your Android device near the NFC receiver. If you do not know where your NFC receiver is located, you may need to move it around some, trying different areas. Once bitwarden detects the YubiKey it will automatically validate and log you in.",

Even if someone were to discover your master password, they could not log into your bitwarden account without access to the secondary step. You can read more about two-step login here. We recommend that all users activate and use two-step login with their bitwarden account.bitwarden supports two-step login using the following methods:Free  Authenticator app such as Authy or Google Authenticator, → setup  Email, → setupPremium  Duo Security with Duo Push, SMS, phone call, and U2F security keys, → setup  YubiKey (any 4 series device or YubiKey NEO), → setup  FIDO U2F (any FIDO U2F certified key), → setupYou can enable multiple two-step login methods. If you have multiple two-step login methods enabled, the order of preference for the default method that is displayed while logging in is as follows: FIDO U2F → YubiKey → Duo → Authenticator app → Email.

Rest assured that this does NOT mean that your account has been compromised or is in danger or being compromised. This notice appears on accounts that registered when bitwarden was using an older encryption scheme.bitwarden has moved to a new encryption key implementation that requires a new key to be generated. This new encryption key allows the use of new features in bitwarden. Normally we are able to handle these type of updates automatically, however, since bitwarden has no knowledge of your encryption key you must initiate this update yourself.Updating your encryption key is simple:  Log into the web vault at https://vault.bitwarden.com  If your encryption key needs to be updated you will find a notice at the top of the page that states so. Click this notification.  A page will pop up that explains why you need to update your encryption key. Enter your master password to verify and your encryption key will be updated. Additionally, all of your data will be re-encrypted with this new key.  VERY IMPORTANT: Log out of and back in to ALL bitwarden applications that you are using. This will download your new encryption key. Failure to complete this last step may result in data corruption in your vault since you would not be using the correct key.",

Select the option you wish to perform: Start, Stop, or Check Status.Optionally, from the command line:Console.exe service [-start] [-stop]                        Description      Argument      Example Value      Required                  Start      -start      n/a      n              Stop      -stop      n/a      n                           Note            The application must be run in administrator mode to be able to manage the background service.        Alternatively, you can also manage the background service from the windows service manager window.  Open the windows start menu.  Search for “Services” and select the Services application.          If you do not find the “Services” application by searching, you can also open it from the “Run” window by typing services.msc.                   Tip            You can configure the bitwarden Directory Connector to run automatically each time the machine starts. Use the windows service manager to set the bitwarden Directory Connector service to “Startup type: Automatic”.        Changing configurations manuallyAll configuration data is saved to a .json configuration file stored on the local computer. No configuration data in synced to bitwarden servers. You can find the configuration file in it’s default location at C:/ProgramData/bitwarden/Directory Connector/settings.json. Any changes that you make directory to the configuration file will require you to restart the application (if it is currently running).             Note            Some configuration data that is stored in the settings file, such as LDAP server credentials, is encrypted. Therefore, you cannot edit these values directly in this file. Any encrypted data must be edited through the application normally.

With proper implementation and a strong encryption key (your master password), AES is considered unbreakable.PBKDF2 is used to derive the encryption key from your master password. This key is then salted and hashed.bitwarden does not write any crypto code. bitwarden only invokes crypto from popular and reputable crypto libraries that are written and maintained by cryptography experts. The following crypto libraries are used:  Javascript (web and browser extension vaults)          Forge      Web Crypto        C# (mobile vault)          CommonCrypto (iOS, Apple)      Javax.Crypto (Android, Oracle)      BouncyCastle (Android)      bitwarden always encrypts and/or hashes your data on your local device before it is ever sent to the cloud servers for syncing. The bitwarden servers are only used for storing encrypted data. It is not possible to get your unencrypted data from the bitwarden cloud servers.",

This new encryption key allows the use of new features in Bitwarden. Normally we are able to handle these type of updates automatically, however, since Bitwarden has no knowledge of your encryption key you must initiate this update yourself.Updating your encryption key is simple:  Log into the web vault at https://vault.bitwarden.com  If your encryption key needs to be updated you will find a notice at the top of the page that states so. Click this notification.  A page will pop up that explains why you need to update your encryption key. Enter your master password to verify and your encryption key will be updated. Additionally, all of your data will be re-encrypted with this new key.  VERY IMPORTANT: Log out of and back in to ALL Bitwarden applications that you are using.

Bitwarden Directory Connector ApplicationThe Bitwarden Directory Connector is cross-platform desktop application that allows you to keep your Bitwarden organization and user directory in sync. Directory Connector can be run on-demand manually as well as automatically in the background on an configured interval. The Directory Connector application can be installed on Windows, macOS, and most Linux distributions.You can install and run Directory Connector as an agent on the server that hosts your directory, an administrator’s workstation, or any other desktop device than can access the directory.

Learn more about how user and group filters work in the following article:  Configuring user and group sync filters        Test a syncYou can run a sync test in order to check that all of your configuration settings are setup and working as expected. A sync test will query the directory server and print the results to the screen. The results that you see printed to the screen will be what is uploaded and synced to your Bitwarden organization whenever a real sync is performed.  Run the Directory Connector application.

Click the Start Sync button from the Sync section.The application will begin polling your directory based on the interval you specified in your sync settings. Be sure not to exit/close the application or automatic syncing intervals will stop. You can minimize the application or hide it to the system tray (under the Window application menu).You can click the Stop Sync button to end the automatic syncing intervals.Clear sync cacheAs the Directory Connector works at syncing changes up to your Bitwarden organization it keeps a local cache. This cache helps the Directory Connector only send the difference in directory changes (deltas) from the previous time that it performed a sync operation. If you encounter sync errors or a particular directory change is not correctly being synced, you may need to clear this cache. Clearing the cache will allow a full sync to occur during the next sync operation.  Run the Directory Connector application.  Go to the More tab.  Click the Clear Sync Cache button from the Other section.Source codeAs with everything here at Bitwarden, the Directory Connector is open source and hosted on GitHub at https://github.com/bitwarden/directory-connector.",

          "content": "As the system administrator of your Bitwarden installation you can use the Admin Portal to do things like:  View installation environment settings  View the currently installed and latest available versions  Browse all registered users and information about them  Delete registered users  Browse all organizations and information about them  Delete organizations             Note            Admins cannot globally view sensitive data that is protected (encrypted) in a user’s or organization’s vault.        The admin portal for your installation is available at https://bitwarden-domain.com/admin.Configuring Admin Portal AccessThe admin portal provides authenticated access to a list of users specified by email address in your installation’s environment file located at ./bwdata/env/global.override.env. For example:adminSettings__admins=john@example.com,bill@gmail.com,tom@example.comThese admin email addresses do not need to be registered with an account on your Bitwarden installation.If you do not want to enable access to the admin portal, you can leave the setting at its default empty value. For example:adminSettings__admins=The admin portal uses a secure means of passwordless authentication. When a user attempts to log into the admin portal a secure link is sent to their email address. The user can click this temporary link to continue logging into the admin portal. The authentication link is active for up to 15 minutes following the log in attempt.             Note            Since the admin portal uses email to provide secure links for authentication, you need to configure your installation’s SMTP mail settings prior to attempting to log into the admin portal.

However, when self-hosting Bitwarden you must implement your own backup procedures in order to keep your data safe.Bitwarden’s Docker containers use volume mapping to keep all important data persisted on the host machine. You can find this data in the ./bwdata directory relative to your bitwarden installation. The Docker containers themselves are to be considered ephemeral and do not persist data or state.You should back up and keep the entire ./bwdata directory safe. In the event of data loss you will need all or parts of data contained in this directory to restore your installation.Some particularly important parts of the ./bwdata directory are:  ./bwdata/mssql/data - database data  ./bwdata/core/attachments - vault item attachments  ./bwdata/env - environment variables, including database and certificate passwordsNightly database backupsBitwarden will automatically take nightly backups of the mssql container database. These database backups are kept in the ./bwdata/mssql/backups directory. Nightly database backups are kept in this directory for 30 days. In the event of data loss, you can restore one of these daily backups.

You should open these ports so that Bitwarden can be accessed from within and/or outside of the network. You can choose different ports during installation if you like.If you are serving Bitwarden to the outside world you will need to configure a domain name with DNS records that point to your host machine (ex. bitwarden.company.com). You should configure this domain before beginning your Bitwarden installation.Alternatively, if you are only testing you can install Bitwarden to the “localhost” domain.Install DockerBitwarden will be deployed and ran on your machine using an array of Docker containers. Bitwarden will work equally well with Docker Community (free) and Enterprise editions. You should evaluate which edition is best for your installation. Additionally, deployment of these containers is orchestrated through the use of Docker Compose. Docker and Docker Compose must first be installed on your machine before beginning a Bitwarden installation.See the following official Docker documentation for more information:  Install Docker  Install Docker Compose             Note            Some Docker installations such as Windows and macOS already come with Docker Compose installed.        For reference, you can find the official Bitwarden images hosted on Docker Hub at https://hub.docker.com/u/bitwarden/.Install BitwardenWe’ve made installing Bitwarden very simple. Depending on your environment (non-Windows vs. Windows) we provide Bash (Linux and macOS) and PowerShell (Windows) scripts to aide in installing and managing your Bitwarden installation. The following steps will include references for both Bash and PowerShell.      Download the main Bitwarden script to your machine in the desired location:              Note         All Bitwarden assets will be installed in the ./bwdata directory relative to where the main Bitwarden script resides.           Bash    curl -s -o bitwarden.sh \\    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bitwarden/core/master/scripts/bitwarden.sh \\    &amp;&amp; sudo chmod u+x bitwarden.sh         PowerShell    Invoke-RestMethod -OutFile bitwarden.ps1 `    -Uri https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bitwarden/core/master/scripts/bitwarden.ps1            Start the installer:      Bash    ./bitwarden.sh install         PowerShell    .\\bitwarden.ps1 -install            Complete the prompts in the installer.    SSL Certificate                  Bitwarden can generate and maintain renewal of a trusted SSL certificate for your domain for completely free provided by Let’s Encrypt and Certbot. Certificate renewal checks occur each time bitwarden is restarted.            If you already have your own SSL certificate you can place the following files in the ./bwdata/ssl/your.domain.com directory:                  certificate.crt (required). If not done so already, you may need to bundle your primary certificate with any intermediate certificates provided by the CA or else you will receive SSL trust errors. ex. cat domain.crt ca.crt &gt;&gt; certificate.crt. See here for more information.          private.key (required)          ca.crt (optional, if trusted)          dhparam.pem (optional, if using Diffie Hellman ephemeral parameters). You can create your own dhparam.pem by using OpenSSL with openssl dhparam -out ./dhparam.pem 2048.                    If you are only testing and do not have an SSL certificate, a self-signed certificate will be generated for your installation.        Installation Id/Key    Each Bitwarden installation requires a unique installation id and installation key. The installation id and key is used to:          Register your installation and contact email so that we can contact you in case of important security updates      Validate licensing of paid features      Authenticate to push relay servers for push notifications (see below)        You should not share your installation id or installation key across multiple Bitwarden installations. They should be treated as secrets.    You can obtain an installation id and key from https://bitwarden.com/host.    Push Notifications    If you would like to take advantage of having push notifications automatically keep your Bitwarden client applications synced in real time you can choose to use the bitwarden push notification relay service. This relay service is provided by external Bitwarden servers. You should ensure that your machine can communicate with the https://push.bitwarden.com endpoint. Your Bitwarden installation will POST non-sensitive data (reference ids) to the push relay service which will then notify the Bitwarden client applications to “phone home” back to your installation for an update.    The use of the push notification relay service is optional. If you do not use this service you will need to keep your client applications in sync manually.  Post-install Environment ConfigurationSome features such as a SMTP mail server settings, YubiKey OTP API credentials, etc. are not configured by the installer. You can find the environment file for these settings (and all others) in the following location: ./bwdata/env/global.override.env. Edit this file and REPLACE the placeholders values for them.Example:globalSettings__yubico__clientId=294620155globalSettings__yubico__key=owdez88RdxVZuGbZ4fvglobalSettings__mail__smtp__host=smtp.sendgrid.netglobalSettings__mail__smtp__username=apikeyglobalSettings__mail__smtp__password=SG.YOUR.API_KEYglobalSettings__mail__smtp__ssl=trueglobalSettings__mail__smtp__port=587globalSettings__mail__smtp__useDefaultCredentials=falseIf you plan to use YubiKeys for two-step login, you can get your YubiKey client id and key at https://upgrade.yubico.com/getapikey/.Start BitwardenOnce you’ve completed installing and configuring your Bitwarden installation you can start it up:             Note            The first time you start Bitwarden it may take some time as it downloads all of the images from Docker Hub.          Bash./bitwarden.sh start PowerShell.\\bitwarden.ps1 -startYou can then verify that all containers are up and running correctly:docker ps                    Finally, you need to initialize and update the Bitwarden database:  Bash./bitwarden.sh updatedb PowerShell.\\bitwarden.ps1 -updatedbCongratulations! Bitwarden is now up and running at https://your.domain.com. Visit the web vault in your web browser to confirm. You should register a new account and log in.Script CommandsThe Bitwarden main script (bitwarden.sh or bitwarden.ps1) has the following commands available:             Note            PowerShell users will run the commands with a prefixed - (switch). For example .\\bitwarden.ps1 -start.                                Command      Description                  install      Start the installer.              start      Start all containers.              restart      Restart all containers (same as start).              stop      Stop all containers.              updatedb      Update/initialize the database.              update      Update all containers and the database.              updateself      Update this main script.

The LastPass exporter may change (HTML encode) these and possibly other special characters in your passwords to their respective HTML encoded values (ex. &amp;amp;, &amp;gt;, and &amp;lt;). If this LastPass bug affects your exported data you should use a text editor (such as Notepad) to find and replace all of these values before importing into Bitwarden. For example, you may want to do a find and replace for &amp;amp; → &amp; and &amp;lt; → &lt;).        Import your data into Bitwarden  Go to the Bitwarden web vault and log in.  Navigate to Tools → Import Data.  Select LastPass as the file format and paste the CSV content into the textbox that you copied to your clipboard in step 4 above.          Click into the textbox with your mouse, then right click with your mouse and select Paste.        Click the Import button.Congratulations! You have just transferred all of your data from LastPass into Bitwarden.Importing form fills (optional)LastPass does not include form fills with the standard export from the LastPass web vault. If you want to import form fill information into Bitwarden you can export the form fill CSV data from the LastPass browser extension.             Note            You can only export form fill data from the LastPass browser extension.          Click the LastPass icon from the browser toolbar to open the LastPass popup interface.

To resolve this you can either:  Tell Android to ignore battery optimization for the Bitwarden app; or  Manually turn on the Bitwarden Auto-fill Service each timeThe auto-fill notification does not appear when I visit a login page in my web browser.This is a currently a known issue with the following browsers, which do not support accessibility services:  Firefox for Android - As a workaround you can use the Bitwarden Firefox addon instead. Navigate to Firefox Settings → Addons and search for “bitwarden”.  Samsung Internet BrowserAndroid has many web browsers. It can be hard to keep up with them all. We have to add support for each browser individually. If auto-fill does not work and your browser is not listed above please report it at https://github.com/bitwarden/mobile/issues so that we can add support.Bitwarden is using a lot of my device's battery power.Unfortunately Android accessibility services can be fairly resource intensive on certain devices.

Custom fields have a name, a value, and a type (text, hidden, and boolean).Auto-filling custom fieldsCustom field names are an important identifier. Depending on the name you give your custom field, Bitwarden will attempt to auto-fill the custom field’s value for you. If you intend to auto-fill custom fields you should name your field based on an identifier from the webpage form. These names are searched for using the following criteria:  HTML form element’s id attribute  then the HTML form element’s name attribute  then the HTML form element’s corresponding label value  then the HTML form element’s placeholder valueIf one of these matches is found, Bitwarden will auto-fill the custom field’s value for you.Special name prefixes for auto-fillingWhen Bitwarden searches a webpage’s form elements to match with your custom field’s name, an exact, case-insensitive comparison is done. For example, if your custom field has the name “PIN”, the following form element’s values (from the id, name, label, etc) will match for auto-filling: “pin”, “PIN”, and “Pin”. However, values such as “pin2” or “mypin” will not match.There are two special name prefixes that can give you even more control over how your custom field is auto-filled:CSVPrefixing your custom field’s name with csv= allows you to specify multiple names to search for and compare when an auto-fill is performed.Example:csv=pin,pin2,mypin will match all of the examples above.Regular ExpressionsPrefixing your custom field’s name with regex= allows you to perform regular expression comparisons when an auto-fill is performed.Example:regex=pin will match all of the examples above.Example:regex=^first.*name will match “firstName”, “First_name”, and “First Name”.",

          "content": "A login item stored in your vault can have one or more URI values associated with it. URIs can relate your login to a website address (URL), server IP address, mobile app package ID, and more. URIs are important values for a login since they determine how the auto-fill functions in Bitwarden will behave.URI protocolsA well-formed URI also has a protocol at the beginning of it. The most common protocol that many of us are familiar with is the http:// protocol used for a website address.The protocol can also have special meaning in Bitwarden:  http:// or https:// tells Bitwarden that this is a website address. Example: https://www.google.com  androidapp:// tells Bitwarden that this is an android application package ID (or package name). Example: androidapp://com.twitter.android. Android apps typically follow reverse domain name notation.             Note            If a URI omits the protocol, http:// is assumed.        Match detection optionsEach URI for a login item also has an associated “match detection” value. The match detection value determines whether or not Bitwarden will offer the login as an available option when performing an auto-fill.While editing a login you can adjust the match detection value for a given URI by selecting the  Options button next to the URI’s value.The following match detection options are available:Base domain             Note            Base domain is the default match detection value for all URIs.        The base domain is defined as the second-level domain plus the top-level domain of the given URI. A URI with a value of https://www.google.com would have a base domain value of google.com.Example:  URI base domain value: https://www.google.com  Matches: http://google.com, https://accounts.google.com, https://sub.accounts.google.com, https://accounts.google.com/page.html  Not matches: https://google.net, https://yahoo.comHostThe host is defined as the hostname plus an optional port of the given URI. A URI with a value of https://sub.domain.com:4000 would have a host value of sub.domain.com:4000.Example:  URI host value: https://sub.domain.com:4000  Matches: http://sub.domain.com:4000, http://sub.domain.com:4000/page.html  Not matches: https://domain.com, https://sub.domain.com, https://sub2.domain.com, https://sub.domain.com:5000Starts withThe “starts with” option requires that the current website/application URI must start with the value defined in the URI. A URI with a value of https://sub.domain.com/path/page.html?query=123 starts with https://sub.domain.com/path/.Example:  URI starts with value: https://sub.domain.com/path/  Matches: https://sub.domain.com/path/, https://sub.domain.com/path/page.html  Not matches: https://sub.domain.com/path (notice the missing trailing slash), https://sub.domain.com, https://sub.domain.com:4000/path/page.html (has a port)Regular expression             Warning            Regular expressions are an advanced option and can be quite dangerous if used incorrectly. You should not use this option if you do not know exactly what you are doing.        The regular expression option allows you to write any simple or complex regular expression to match the current website/application URI. All regular expressions are case insensitive.Example:  URI regex value: ^https://.*google.com  Matches: https://google.com, https://sub.google.com, https://sub.sub2.google.com, https://malicious-site.com?q=google.com  Not matches: http://google.com (not https), https://yahoo.comExactThe “exact” option requires that the current website/application URI exactly match the value defined in the URI.Example:  URI exact value: https://www.google.com/page.html  Matches: https://www.google.com/page.html  Not matches: http://www.google.com/page.html (not https), https://www.google.com/page.html?query=123, https://www.google.comNeverA URI with match detection set to “Never” will never be offered for auto-fill.Example:  URI never value: https://www.google.com  Matches: none  Not matches: https://www.google.com, https://google.com, https://sub.google.com/page.html",

This “website icons” feature allows you to easily identify particular logins in your vault by a recognizable icon. This is usually represented by a logo or brand image of that website. The Bitwarden icons server provides the delivery endpoint for these website icons.If you are using the “website icons” feature on a device, Bitwarden will issue requests to icons.bitwarden.com for each item of type “Login” in your vault that has a URI that resembles a website (ex. google.com or https://google.com, but not google or http://localhost). The icons server is fronted with a CDN that caches the icons on Cloudflare’s edge nodes all around the world. Subsequent requests to the same icon will likely hit CDN caches instead of the icons server directly. Your requests may never actually hit Bitwarden’s icons server because another Bitwarden user with the same website in their vault requested the icon before you.Privacy concernsBecause a request for an icon image contains the hostname of the website stored in your vault, it is important to understand that this feature will “leak” otherwise cryptographically protected information to Bitwarden servers and/or CDN endpoints. An example of a icon request looks like the following:https://icons.bitwarden.com/google.com/icon.pngThe icons server endpoints do not log or collection any information regarding icon image requests. However, this is something you would have to take our word for since we have no way to demonstrate this publicly other than reviewing our open source codebase.Disabling website iconsWe understand that certain privacy-minded users may not want to use the “website icons” feature. We provide the option to disable website icons on all Bitwarden client applications:  Web vault: Settings → Web Vault Options → Disable Website Icons  Browser extension: Settings → Options → Disable Website Icons  Mobile app: Settings → Options → Disable Website IconsWhen the website icons feature is disabled, Bitwarden will opt to show you a generic, locally accessed icon instead () that is the same for all login items stored in your vault.",

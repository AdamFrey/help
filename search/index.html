The only option to gain access to the account again is to have the account deleted by contacting bitwarden support. Note that deleting the account will also delete all of your stored login data associated with the account.

A sync simulation will query the directory server and print the results to the screen. The results that you see printed to the screen will be what is uploaded and synced to your bitwarden organization whenever a real sync is invoked.  Launch the Directory Connector console by double clicking the shortcut.  Select option 5 (Simulate directory sync) from the main menu.  Review the results that are printed in the console window for accuracy.Optionally, from the command line:Console.exe sim [-f]            Description      Argument      Example Value      Required      Notes                  Force      -f      n/a      n      Forces a full sync.

Select option 6 (Sync directory) from the main menu.Optionally, from the command line:Console.exe sync [-f]            Description      Argument      Example Value      Required      Notes                  Force      -f      n/a      n      Forces a full sync.      Manage the background serviceThe background service allows sync operations to run in the background based on the interval set in your sync configuration.  Launch the Directory Connector console by double clicking the shortcut.  Select option 7 (Control background service) from the main menu.  Select the option you wish to perform: Start, Stop, or Check Status.Optionally, from the command line:Console.exe service [-start] [-stop]            Description      Argument      Example Value      Required                  Start      -start      n/a      n              Stop      -stop      n/a      n                   Note            The application must be run in administrator mode to be able to manage the background service.        Alternatively, you can also manage the background service from the windows service manager window.  Open the windows start menu.  Search for “Services” and select the Services application.          If you do not find the “Services” application by searching, you can also open it from the “Run” window by typing services.msc.                   Tip            You can configure the bitwarden Directory Connector to run automatically each time the machine starts. Use the windows service manager to set the bitwarden Directory Connector service to “Startup type: Automatic”.        Changing configurations manuallyAll configuration data is saved to a .json configuration file stored on the local computer. No configuration data in synced to bitwarden servers. You can find the configuration file in it’s default location at C:/ProgramData/bitwarden/Directory Connector/settings.json. Any changes that you make directory to the configuration file will require you to restart the application (if it is currently running).             Note            Some configuration data that is stored in the settings file, such as LDAP server credentials, is encrypted. Therefore, you cannot edit these values directly in this file. Any encrypted data must be edited through the application normally.

Copy this file to the bitwarden Directory Connector program data folder at C:/ProgramData/bitwarden/Directory Connector.          Optionally rename the JSON file to something that is easier to remember, such as client_secret.json        Launch the Directory Connector console by double clicking the shortcut.  Select option 3 (Configure directory connection) from the main menu.  Select GSuite Directory as the type.  Enter the name of the JSON file that you copied in step 2.  Enter the domain of your GSuite account.  Enter the email address of an admin user that has full access to the GSuite directory (such as your own).Congrats!
